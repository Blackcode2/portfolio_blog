#### Features

#### Responsive Web

"responsive_framework" package provided tools and utilities specifically designed for creating responsive web designs in Flutter. With this package, I could automatically adapt my blog's layout and design based on the user's screen size and device orientation.

#### Markdown

In this blog, all posts are created as markdown files. To effectively incorporate markdown files into my Flutter project, flutter_markdown package is used.

In addition to using the flutter_markdown package for incorporating markdown files, I have invested time and effort in developing a specialized logic and structure to efficiently load the markdown files and their metadata.

#### Hosting

GitHub Pages not only offers the advantage of being free but also provides a high degree of freedom in managing and customizing website. I uploaded the whole project to repository then activated the GitHup Pages.

#### Actions and Workflows

I have to repeat manual process each time I update or make adjustments to the project. This inefficiency becomes both frustrating and time-consuming.

However, there's a solution: GitHub Actions. By leveraging GitHub Actions, I can automate the hosting and deployment process. This means I no longer have to manually handle it every time you make changes. GitHub Actions streamlines the workflow, allowing you to focus on your project without the hassle of repetitive tasks.
